### Hi there üëã, I'm Nicol√°s Aranda, Razkaroth on the internet.

I'm a former physics student, turned software developer.



I started programming in 2018 with simulations of physical systems in Python while on college. A year later, here I was learning and developing my skills in Full stack web development, data analysis and visualization.

Currently I work as CTO / Lead software developer for the media outlet [POPLab.mx](https://poplab.mx), where I have developed a secure and high-performance web platform for the journalists to publish their investigations. I have also worked with journalists on digital security issues, complex crawler development, and data analysis and visualization.

As a freelancer, [I have worked as the lead developer of the SART platform](sart.pdf) (Early warning and response system) for the
Ministry of Human Rights of the Republic of Honduras on 2021.

I have won the 2021 national journalism award in Mexico for my contribution to the web design and development of the report [‚ÄúCarlos Zamarripa, el caudillo de la justicia mexicana.‚Äù](https://elcaudillo.poplab.mx/), a report on the general prosecutor office in Gto, Mexico.

And more recently, the international [Fetisov Journalism Awards](https://fjawards.com/) for my contribution to the web design and development of the report ["Las Fichas de Coca Cola"](https://poplab.mx/especiales/las-fichas-de-coca/), a report on the Coca Cola Company's influence public health policies.
